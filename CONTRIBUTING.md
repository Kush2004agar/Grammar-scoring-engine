## Code Style

We try to keep the code:
- **Readable** - Someone should be able to understand it without a PhD
- **Well-documented** - Comments explain the "why", not just the "what"
- **Honest** - If something is a workaround or has limitations, we say so

## Questions?

Just ask! Open an issue or reach out. We're friendly, I promise. 😊
