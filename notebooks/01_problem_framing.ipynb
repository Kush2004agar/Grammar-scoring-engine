        "## Phase 1 — Problem Framing (Spoken Grammar Quality)\n",
        "\n",
        "This notebook documents the **assessment-science framing** of the grammar scoring engine for the SHL Intern Hiring Assessment.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Construct definition\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Primary construct**: spoken grammatical accuracy and appropriateness in work-relevant English.\n",
        "- Focus on morphosyntax (tense/aspect, subject–verb agreement, pronouns, prepositions, word order) and sentence/clause well-formedness in spontaneous responses.\n",
        "\n",
        "### What is not being measured\n",
        "\n",
        "- Overall job performance or potential.\n",
        "- General cognitive ability (reasoning, problem-solving).\n",
        "- Personality, motivation, or socio-emotional skills.\n",
        "- Content quality, factual accuracy, or domain knowledge.\n",
        "- Accent quality or pronunciation as primary constructs.\n",
        "- Adherence to a specific prestige dialect beyond what is needed for mutual intelligibility in an international business context.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Intended assessment use\n",
        "\n",
        "- One component in a multi-method assessment battery for intern/early-career roles requiring English communication.\n",
        "- Supports screening/triage and, where job analysis supports it, minimum proficiency thresholds for spoken grammar.\n",
        "- Should never be the sole basis for high-stakes decisions.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Automation risks and ethics\n",
        "\n",
        "- **ASR bias** across accents/dialects and recording conditions.\n",
        "- **Construct underrepresentation** (focusing on a subset of grammar features) and **contamination** (prosody, audio quality, content).\n",
        "- **Fairness** and potential subgroup impact when ASR or models behave differently across candidate groups.\n",
        "- **Transparency and contestability** of scores (ability to explain and challenge outcomes).\n",
        "- **Privacy and data governance** for voice data.\n",
        "\n",
        "This notebook intentionally contains **no code**; it serves as a conceptual anchor for all subsequent technical work.\n"
